**Rik Spanjers, co-founder**


Rik Spanjers is a PhD researcher at the University of Amsterdam. His thesis project aims to foster an understanding of how historical comics represent the past by using the textual and pictorial representational strategies afforded by the comic book form and the history of the medium. Next to his research, Spanjers teaches courses in the Bachelor program for Dutch Studies and a cross-departmental Masters level comics course. He is also a founding member of the History, Trauma, Comics Online Research Circle, which hosts monthly online presentations. In his spare time, Spanjers writes reviews and articles for Stripschrift and Aniway.
