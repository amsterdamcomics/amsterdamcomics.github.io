Founded in 2014, Amsterdam Comics is an independent research consortium that seeks to productively clash theory with practice through several strategiesâ€”both academic and public. Following from our inaugural international conference in the summer of 2015, we founded a guest lecture and master class series and a comics theory reading group. We also guest edited an issue of [_Image [&] Narrative_](http://www.imageandnarrative.be/index.php/imagenarrative/issue/view/79) (October 2016), hosted our second international conference in 2018, and are in the final stages of production on _Key Terms in Comics Studies_, we co-edited with Simon Grennan, which will be published later this year. If you are interested in joining us, please contact us at info{at}amsterdamcomics.com
