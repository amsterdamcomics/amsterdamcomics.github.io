## Amsterdam Comics Conference

## "Comics Interaction"


### 1-3 July 2015


Amsterdam Comics is pleased to announce the call for papers for our inaugural international conference, 
“Comics Interaction,” which will take place from 1-3 July in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

<br>

Comprised of three days of parallel panel sessions, round table discussions, and public keynote lectures, the
conference aims to encourage interdisciplinary connections between comics scholars from various disciplines, comics
artists, publishers, and cultural workers from cultural heritage sites. Hosted at the University of Amsterdam and
several cultural institutions in the city, the conference aims to highlight the connections between the academic
field of comics studies and the greater comics milieu.

Keynote Speakers:
Prof. Dr. Jan Baetens, University of Leuven, Belgium
Prof. Dr. Bart Beaty, University of Calgary, Canada
Dr. Joyce Goggin, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands

Themes:
1. Comics in Art, Art in Comics 
The question of the place of comics within the system of the arts is an ongoing—and multifaceted—debate. As comics
slowly enters academic and art discourse through the side doors of the university and the museum, the questions of 
whether comics is part of “the culture industry” or if it is indeed the “ninth art” have given way to questions of 
hierarchy within the form itself. These questions, which include delineations of “high” and “low,” genre 
distinctions, and when and how to (re)present comics in exhibitions, however, often signal a return to the initial 
problematic: does comics belong in the category of arts—and, if so, where? The conference invites papers that 
investigate, for example: the art of comics; the medium and/or form of comics; “high” vs. “low” culture / mass market
vs. art; comics in the museum; and art’s (ab)use of comics and vice versa.

2. History and Trauma in Comics 
The publication of Art Spiegelman’s Maus gave new direction to the discussions concerning the propensity of the comic
book medium to represent historic and traumatic events. It would be a mistake, however, to see Maus as the genesis of
historical and traumatic narratives in comic book form. Since the early beginnings of the medium, comics have dealt
with the historic and traumatic in a wide variety of ways and for very different purposes. Historical comic books
entertain, educate, wound, and heal. The conference invites papers that investigate the ways, purposes, and
discursive environments in which comics deal with issues of memory, history, and trauma. Topics include, for example:
(auto)biography & memoir; repetition; testimony; remembering; forgetting; comics in relation to other modes of
historiography; the impact of comics on the dynamics of national, regional, and international remembrance; and comics
and/as therapy.

3. Comics as World Literature 
The concept of “world literature” no longer focuses on the worldwide circulation of (Western) canonical works, but is
currently employed to study literature as a global and intercultural phenomenon. Similarly, comics scholarship is
presently shifting from its traditional emphasis on specific national and/or European contexts to a focus on the
interaction between different comics traditions and the ways in which comics travel the world, including the various
linguistic, legal and cultural boundaries that they encounter in this process. However, this does not make questions
concerning the cultural and national specificity of comics superfluous. The conference therefore invites papers that
explore the possibilities of tensions of reading comics as a form of “world literature,” including, for example: the
international reception of comics; manga (around the world); comics and (possibilities of) translation; and comics
and/as literature.
