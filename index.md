## Amsterdam Comics Reading Group

### 2015-2016

We are pleased to announce the monthly reading group for Amsterdam Comics, which will commence on 10 December from 17.00-19.00.

What we envision: 

Each month we will read one or more seminal comics scholarship texts and meet to engage in theoretical discussions about the shape of comics discourse today and where we think it needs advancing, complicating, clarification, etc. 

Our meetings will last 2 hours, during which time a scheduled leader will present on the text before the group enters into discussion. We encourage members to bring in comics works that they think fit with the selected material, and of course, we also want to build our discussions from month to month by referring back to texts from previous months.

Meeting #1: 

On Thursday, 10 December, we will meet from 17.00-19.00 in the P. C. Hoofthuis of the University of Amsterdam (room to be determined). We will discuss Thierry Groensteen’s influential The System of Comics (2007 English translation). Rik Spanjers will offer introductory remarks, we will discuss the work, and also discuss our next meeting time and reading material. 

Join us:
