Founded in 2014, Amsterdam Comics is an independent research consortium that seeks to productively clash theory with practice through several strategiesâ€”both academic and public. Following from our inaugural international conference in the summer of 2015, we founded a bi-annual guest lecture and master class series and a comics theory reading group. We also recently guest edited an issue of [Image [&] Narrative](http://www.imageandnarrative.be/index.php/imagenarrative/issue/view/79) (October 2016), and are in the early planning stages our second international conference and an experimental comics exhibition. If you are interested in joining us, please contact us at info{at}amsterdamcomics.com
